* org-colviewx

Some extensions and configuration for the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Column-View.html][column
view]] of Emacs Org mode ([[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/org/org-colview.el][org-colview.el]]).

This turns column view into a proper minor mode; modernizes its visual appearance; improves and extends viewing, navigation and editing commands; adds sorting and filtering commands; plus provides some useful transformers for use with =org-columns-modify-value-for-display-function=.

Install as usual, for example with straight.el using =(use-package org-colviewx :straight (:repo "orgtre/org-colviewx"))= in your init.el. Then just activate column view (=M-x org-columns=) when in an Org mode buffer: all the keybindings listed in the hydra below are active as long as the cursor is on a heading with a column view overlay.

For an overview of the available commands and their default keybindings, org-colviewx comes with a [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] which also includes the commands provided by org-colview.el (see [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Using-column-view.html][standard column view bindings]]). The hydra is shown below. To use it call the command =org-colviewx-hydra=. It is recommended that you bind it to a key by putting something like this in your configuration:

: (org-defkey org-columns-map "x" #'org-colviewx-hydra)

Note that all the keybindings listed in the hydra also work without calling the hydra, as long as the cursor is on a column view overlay. Each =u= means that the command takes one universal argument (=C-u=) and =n= means it takes a numeric prefix argument.

At this stage in the development cycle org-colviewx would greatly benefit if you'd test it a bit, report any issues that come up, and provide suggestions for improvement!
